# Bese Price Finder
 
Basically just me messing with web scraping using BeautifulSoup
### price.py
Finding the best deal on the web online section(網購) of Price.com.hk of your desired product, saving you time from going through all pages on the website just to look for the cheapest offering. Soldout items are all ignored as well. You can `Hold Cmd (macOS)/Ctrl (Windows)` and click on each result inside the terminal, the browser will be opened and redirect to the item's page on Price.com.hk.

The result is sorted by the price, and also saved to a separate .txt file.
